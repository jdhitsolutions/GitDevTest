This is a scratch repository for testing git commands and concepts. Nothing in this repository is of any value other than the experience of working with Git and GitHub.

Anyone is welcome to fork or clone this repository for testing or practice. If you want to try a pull request, go right ahead and I'll do my best to respond in a timely manner.

_Because this is a testing repo things can and will break so be flexible. Everything is a learning opportunity._
