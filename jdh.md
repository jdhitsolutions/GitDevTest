# Jeff Hicks

:computer: I am a veteran IT Pro and scripting fiend, going all the way back to batch files in the early days of DOS. I create content, code, and courses intended to teach PowerShell or to make an IT Pro's job a little easier. I blog frequently at <https://jdhitsolutions.com/blog> and you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeffhicks)
