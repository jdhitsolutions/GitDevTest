# Jeff Hicks

I am a veteran IT Pro and scripting fiend, going all the way back to batch files in the early days of DOS. I create content, code, and courses intended to teach PowerShell or to make an IT Pro's job a little easier. I blog frequently at <https://jdhitsolutions.com/blog>, and you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeffhicks).

## :bulb:Current Work

These are some of my current GitHub projects. Much of my work is PowerShell-related, and most modules can be installed from the PowerShell Gallery.

## :book: Books and Courses :mortar_board:

In addition to the well-known [_Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches_](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-windows-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches-third-edition?a_aid=jdhit&a_bid=2326a8ab) books, you can find my other work on Leanpub.

|   |   |
|---|---|
![PowerShell PracticePrimer](images/psprimer-thumb.png) | [_The PowerShell Practice Primer_](https://leanpub.com/psprimer) isn't a book to teach your PowerShell, but rather to re-inforce what you already know through 100+ console-based exercises. No scripting is required.
![PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking](images/pstoolmaking-thumbnail.png) | If you have read [_Learn PowerShell Scripting in a Month of Lunches_](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-scripting-in-a-month-of-lunches?a_aid=jdhit&a_bid=2326a8ab), then you are ready for the next step. Don Jones and I wrote this book intending it to be the definitive guide on everything you need to know to be a better PowerShell scripter and toolmaker.

![pluralsight](images/pluralsight_logo.png)

I have been creating video training courses for over 10 years. I have a large course catalog at [Pluralsight](pluralsight.pxf.io/qbR6n), with an emphasis on PowerShell-related content. If you are just getting started with PowerShell 7, [I got you covered\(pluralsight.pxf.io/Lbvya) there as well.
